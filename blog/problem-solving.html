        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <div id="blog-txt">
          <h3>Blocked Problem:</h3>
          <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
          <p>I was stuck on the deBee problem from 'Built-in Methods' where the function had to provide an answer to 3 problems.</p>
          <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
          <p>I mainly used Gemini, Google's AI. However it gave the answer to 2 out of 3 problems, and never the full answer.</p>
          <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
          <p>Stuck, like I couldn't understand why Gemini wasn't giving me the full answer + the meaning of it all (which is how I learn).</p>
          <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
          <p>How to ask Gemini questions correctly, as their AI does need to learn a bit more better when answering questions.</p>
          <h3>Solved A Problem:</h3>
          <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
          <p>Event 0 - The Warm Up</p>
          <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
          <p>Created the athlete profiles, and added them to the athleteArray.</p>
          <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
          <p>Very good because I've used the .push method before.</p>
          <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
          <p>Nothing new, but I felt good knowing how to already use a method.</p>
          <h3>Problem Solving Techniques/Processes</h3>
          <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>Haven't tried this method yet, will look into it</p>
          <h4>Trying something</h4>
          <p>I've tried a few times with this, only on known methods I know of.</p>
          <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
          <p>Haven't tried this one yet either.</p>
          <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
          <p>I can read error messages pretty well, sometimes they don't make sense.</p>
          <h4>Console.logging</h4>
          <p>Have definitely used this to see where I'm going wrong on an answer</p>
          <h4>Googling</h4>
          <p>Used this method a few times</p>
          <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
          <p>I have asked for help in Discord, some answers are good, but some I need to understand better.</p>
          <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
          <p>Have recently asked for help on this, got a reply and haven't replied back yet.</p>
          <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
          <p>Yep.</p>
