        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <div id="blog-txt">
          <h3>Blocked Problem:</h3>
          <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
          <p>The problem I had was with the deBee function from the 'Built-In Methods' part of Sprint 4.<br>I was trying to find to figure out how to create the function to solve all 3 problems from the index.test.js file.<br>I was able to solve 2 out of the 3 problems, but the problem I had with the code was, there was an extra space added to the words. </p>
          <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
          <p>I mainly used Gemini, Google's AI. However it gave the answer to 2 out of 3 problems, and never the full answer.<br>I really had to ask Gemini the right questions in order to get the right complete answer so I can learn what I have been doing wrong.<br>I eventually was able to solve the problem with the right code, and learned how everything worked.</p>
          <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
          <p>Very frustrated as the code was solving 2 out of 3 problems, but not all.<br>I knew I was missing something very basic code wise, I just wasn't sure what it was.<br>But in the end, with the right questioning, I found the correct code to solve my problem.</p>
          <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
          <p>What code does work and what doesn't.<br>But also how to ask Gemini the right questions to get the correct code to learn from.<br>The best thing about Gemini is it gives you a very basic understand of how all the code works step by step after giving the answer.</p>
          <h3>Solved A Problem:</h3>
          <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
          <p>Event 0 - The Warm Up - This was all about Arrays in Javascript and how to add to them.<br>
            I had to create an athlete's profile for myself and someone I knew, and then add them to the Array.</p>
          <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
          <p>Trying something - by using the .push method as I have used this before. It's very easy problem to solve.</p>
          <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
          <p>Great as I've used this method before. The .push method is very easy to use. It didn't take long to solve.</p>
          <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
          <p>Nothing new, but I felt good knowing how to already use a method.</p>
          <h3>Problem Solving Techniques/Processes</h3>
          <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>Haven't tried this method yet, will look into it</p>
          <h4>Trying something</h4>
          <p>I've tried a few times with this, only on known methods I know of.</p>
          <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
          <p>Haven't tried this one yet either.</p>
          <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
          <p>I can read error messages pretty well, sometimes they don't make sense.</p>
          <h4>Console.logging</h4>
          <p>Have definitely used this to see where I'm going wrong on an answer</p>
          <h4>Googling</h4>
          <p>Used this method a few times</p>
          <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
          <p>I have asked for help in Discord, some answers are good, but some I need to understand better.</p>
          <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
          <p>Have recently asked for help on this, got a reply and haven't replied back yet.</p>
          <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
          <p>Yep.</p>
