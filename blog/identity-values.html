        <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
        <div id="blog-txt">
          <h4>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
          <p>Well, there is a long time viewer of my Minecraft streams who is generally a joker type of guy, but sometimes can't distinguish between when he's joking or being silly. There was a moment where I had to ban him from my stream because of the way he treated another viewer, and I kept that ban going for a few months because I wasn't happy with the way he treated that person. Eventually maybe a year later I unbanned him and let him know, and he has since returned to my streams to say hello etc. Reflecting on it now, I could have unbanned him earlier than a year, but I really wanted to teach him a lesson in how to treat people, as I don't think anyone really has. </p>
          <h4>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
          <p>While being Maori is pretty awesome, I have learned from my friends & family how to not just be an awesome person, but be an interesting person that people would want to get to know better.</p>
          <h4>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
          <p>I can be a fast learner at certain things, especially if I'm very interested in it - and the best thing about that, is it won't feel like a chore to do certain tasks.</p>
          <h4>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
          <p>I can only learn so much in a day, so with the right amount of breaks etc I can get into a great routine where I shouldn't have any problems learning going forward.</p>
          <h4>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>
          <p>Back in 2004 I was working for Telecon (aka Spark) on their broadband helpdesk - One call I got was a customer had his internet disconnected 3-4 days before he was moving out, so I had to get off the phones and call around 5+ different telecon departments to get the customer reconnected. I was off the phones for about 4 hours (10am-2pm) and just before 2pm I got the customer reconnected. Now at the time, I had an awesome manager who knew exactly who to call and get all this done, so that basically meant no real resistance or tension for me, and the strategy we had worked out in our favour as we got the customer reconnected in under 4 hours.</p>
