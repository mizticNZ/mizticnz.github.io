          <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
          <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
          <p>I would like to be a Principal Software Engineer within 3-5 years as I see myself incharge of my own team of software engineers</p>
          <h4>2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>My greatest strength is being very interested in coding, so I'm hoping that will keep me excited about everything I learn here. The only limitations I would have is I can only learn so much in a day, so here's hoping I can get through this bootcamp and really come out a professional at the end.</p>
          <h4>3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
          <p>Just remembering the difference between javascript methods, functions, arrays, objects etc.</p>
          <h4>4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
          <p>Being able to get my head around things so I can easily refer to them in future use no problem. Repeativeness would be key, especially with some exercises.</p>
          <h4>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
          <p>To have a super awesome teacher to learn from, and can easily understand any questions I have, especially if I don't understand a certain problem.</p>
          <h4>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
          <p>To be proficient in React/Node/Express and whatever DB software we use. So much so, that I could end up being a freelance software developer and work from anywhere in the world.</p>
          
          <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
          <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
          <p>To be in charge of my own team of software engineers - or failing that, Technical Lead, Principal Software Engineer. </p>
          <h4>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
          <p>If it interests me (such as this, coding in html/css/js) then I can easily learn things. Of course, I can only learn so much within a certain amount of time.</p>
          <h4>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
          <p>To be able to explain things correctly, especially when referring to javascript/typescript stuff like objects/arrays/varibles etc.</p>
          <h4>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
          <p>As long as I have the work in front of me, I'll have a clear understanding of what is expected of me and I can happily work well with others, as well as offer advice if needed.</p>
          <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
          <p>If i've been working on something for too long (2 hrs+) then I'll stop for a few mins (5-10 mins) have a break, and ask around to see what I'm doing wrong. Failing that, try and google why certain things aren't working.</p>
          <h4>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
          <p>Normally when I can't understand why things are working out for me, so I'll ask for help. Otherwise I can easily google the problem and see what solutions there  are out there.</p>
          <h4>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
          <p>Hopefully a great learning experience when it comes to the bootcamp side of things.</p>
          <h4>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
          <p>I should be all ok for this, but if anything comes up I'll definitely let people know.</p>
