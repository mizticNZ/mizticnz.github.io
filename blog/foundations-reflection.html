          <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
          <p>1. I've learned how to properly use certain methods, statements etc in a more structed way than just watching random youtube videos. It's been very good for me as I can now learn deeper about certain javascript things coming up during bootcamp and in my free time.<br>

            2. I've learned to actively listen more with pair programming, being able to understand certain features from each other eg array vs object, function vs method etc.<br>
            
            3. Learning how to properly explain things is one of the problems I had when I started, but can now say I've improved a lot in recently with the pairing up with other classmates to go over exercises.</p>
          <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
          <p>Being able to independently look up solutions to problems without having to ask people all the time, and being able to learn from that first hand. Asking is great, and always there, but its better to lookup certain things before asking for help.</p>
          <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
          <p>Learning how to properly speak to people, whether in teams or pairs. I've been out of work for a few years, and its great to have some tips on how to speak up around people.</p>
          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
          <p>Being able to write paragraphs for answers to certain questions that I can easily give one sentence answers to.</p>
          <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
          <p>So if i'm successful at getting a job, I can easily fit into a team and get along with everybody very well. Not only that, but understand everything that is going on (technically speaking).</p>
          <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
          <p>Yes and No. Yes (to coding) because I want to get to know certain javascript methods better; No because I also have been out of work for a few years so I do need all the help I can get so I can fit in well at a new job.</p>
