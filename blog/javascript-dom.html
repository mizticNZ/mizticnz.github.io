            <h3>Making Websites Move: A Beginner's Guide to JavaScript</h3>
          </header>
          <main class="container">
           <p>
            Imagine your website is like a house. The walls and foundation are built with HTML, which provides the basic structure. CSS is like the paint and furniture, making it look nice. But what brings the house to life? That's where JavaScript comes in!<br>
            JavaScript is like the electrical wiring and smart home features. It adds interactivity, making things happen on your website. For instance, clicking a button to see a hidden message pop up, or a form that checks your spelling as you type â€“ that's all JavaScript!
           </p>

           <h4>Making Decisions: Control Flow and Loops</h4>

           <p>
            Websites often need to make choices and repeat actions. This is where control flow and loops come in. Imagine your morning routine. You might check if it's light outside (control flow) and then repeat the action of hitting snooze until you finally get up (loop).<br>
            JavaScript can do similar things. Here's an example:
           </p>
           <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kTWshMT.png"></center>
           <br>
           
           <p>
            In this example, the code checks if a button (submitButton) has been clicked. If it has, it displays a success message. Otherwise, it displays an error message. This is a simple example of control flow.
            Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Here's an example of a loop that displays a list of products on a webpage:
           </p>

           <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uD3HSw1.png"></center>
            <br>

            <p>
              This code loops through an array of product names (products). For each product, it creates a list item and adds it to the product list (productList) on the webpage.
            </p>

            <h4>The Website Blueprint: The DOM</h4>

            <p>
              Every website has a structure, kind of like a blueprint. In the web development world, this blueprint is called the DOM (Document Object Model). It shows how all the HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, images, etc.) are connected to each other.<br>
              JavaScript can interact with the DOM to change the website content. Think of it like rearranging furniture in your house. Here's an example:
            </p>

            <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/B9bhFZ6.png"></center>
            <br>

            <p>
              This code selects the paragraph element with the ID "welcome" (document.getElementById) and then changes its text content (textContent) to a new message.
            </p>

            <h4>Arrays vs. Objects: Organizing Information</h4>

            <p>
              Websites often need to store information. JavaScript uses two main ways to do this: arrays and objects. Imagine you have a list of groceries (array). Each item on the list is separate but in a specific order. An object, on the other hand, is like a recipe card with multiple ingredients listed together (object).<br>
              An array is great for storing similar things in a specific order, like a list of product prices on a shopping website:
            </p>

            <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xfjTp3I.png"></center>
            <br>

            <p>
              This code defines an array of product prices (productPrices). To access the price of a specific product, you use its index number within the array.<br>
              Objects are more flexible, allowing you to group related information together. Here's an example of an object that stores product details:
            </p>

            <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ApTok7L.png"></center>
            <br>

            <p>
              This code defines an object (product) with properties like name, price, and color. You can access these properties using dot notation (product.name) or bracket notation (product["name"]).
            </p>

            <h4>Superhero Coders: Functions to the Rescue</h4>

            <p>
              Imagine you're creating a quiz website. You might have the same logic for checking the answer for every question. Instead of writing that code repeatedly, you can create a function called checkAnswer that takes the user's answer and the correct answer as input. The function can then compare the answers and display a message accordingly (correct or incorrect).<br>
              Here's an example:
            </p>

            <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/syePHKS.png"></center>
            <br>

            <p>
              In this example, the checkAnswer function takes two arguments: the user's answer and the correct answer. It then checks them and returns a message based on the comparison. We can then call this function for each question on our quiz, making our code cleaner and more reusable.<br>
              Functions are the building blocks of well-written JavaScript code. By using functions, you can keep your code organized, avoid repetition, and make your website more efficient and maintainable. As you delve deeper into JavaScript, you'll discover even more powerful ways to use functions to create dynamic and interactive web experiences!
